# Lab: JFrog BOMs basics

## Goals

Practice manipulating JFrog BOMs

## Create a repository structure

in your JFrog Project, create the following repositories :

| Repo type | Repo key                          | Package type | Environment | Comment                                                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LOCAL     | <PROJECT_KEY>-maven-rc-local      | MAVEN        | DEV         |
| LOCAL     | <PROJECT_KEY>-maven-release-local | MAVEN        | PROD        |
| REMOTE    | <PROJECT_KEY>-mavencentral-remote | MAVEN        | DEV         |
| VIRTUAL   | <PROJECT_KEY>-maven               | MAVEN        | DEV         | include the 3 repos above and set default deployement to <PROJECT_KEY>-maven-rc-local |

### Build Info (only from API)

> Here is the [official documentation for the Build Info](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-integrations-documentation/build-integration)

1. Generate an publish a Build Info into your project

   ```bash
      ../../demos/basics-bom/bom-publish.sh <PROJECT_KEY>-maven <PROJECT_KEY>
   ```

2. Go to the Build info section > select a version and navigate on teh different tabs. [View Build Number Information](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-integrations-documentation/view-build-number-information)

### RBv2 (from UI)

> Here is the [official documentation for the Release LifeCycle Management](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/release-lifecycle-management)

1. Generate a Release Bundle V2 from your Build Info
2. Promote your Release Bundle V2 to the PROD environment
3. Add an `ÀRCHIVE` project environment and assign it to <PROJECT_KEY>-archive-maven-local
4. Promote your Release Bundle V2 to the `ÀRCHIVE` environment
