## Test the curation process

1. Ensure that your machine doesn't have Log4J cached, delete the entire `~/.m2/repositoryorg/apache/logging` directory tree, if it exists.
2. On your own machine, using a command prompt, navigate to the [common Java module](../../common/java).       Configure your Maven client to download packages from your remote
    1. Artifactory > virtual repositories > <PROJECT_KEY>-maven
    2. Click on  `Setup Client` & follow the instruction
3. Run ```jf curation-audit```
4. Run a **maven install**

### Block download

1. Delete the entire `org/apache/logging` directory tree, if it exists.
